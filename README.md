# Stroke Prediction Program - Machine Learning
Our stroke prediction program utilizes advanced Machine Learning techniques to analyze a dataset and provide an estimate of the probability of an individual having a stroke or not. Based on characteristics and risk factors such as age, medical history, blood pressure, and lifestyle, the program performs predictive analysis and offers a personalized risk assessment.

By providing this prediction, our program aims to assist in early diagnosis and the adoption of preventive measures, enabling individuals to make informed decisions about their health. Through an intuitive interface and visually presented results, users can access the information in a clear and understandable manner.

Furthermore, the program is constantly enhanced and updated based on new data and medical research, ensuring ongoing accuracy and reliability.
